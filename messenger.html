            <p>To the most beautiful lady... ❣️
                We have gone through quite different phases together
                I've seen uh so emotional but still sooo strong
                I've seen uh so worried but still with that big hope (wish that come true) 
                But most of all we tried to solve it together .... For being there for me nd for ur constant support too.... I still wonder how u accept everything with such a beautiful smileee.... Luvvv uh
